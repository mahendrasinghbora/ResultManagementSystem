# ResultManagementSystem
“Result Management System (RMS)” is a desktop application that can be used by any
university, college or institute that wants to update their manual or existing automated
result management and generation system.
It is designed to facilitate the universities or colleges (at more ease) with customized
information related to every student’s result in every session or semester and overall
back log history (if any) on a single click.
The application can be easily customized as per the requirements of the university or
college. Different result criteria can be added to different courses of a university in
every session or semester (as per the requirement).
It can generate multiple reports for the examination cell like list of all the registered
students, list of all the colleges affiliated to a university, details of back logs course
wise, subject wise and student wise and various other reports on result of the students.
It can help to identify the students who have got back in a particular subject (paper).
It also reduces the amount of paper work involved in the manual result management
and generation hence avoiding data redundancies and inconsistencies, thus making data
storage more easy and efficient. The organization can maintain computerized records
without redundant entries. That means one need not be distracted by information that
is not relevant, while being able to reach the required information.
